- `identity/` — Logs and states of operating identity (Reflector, Builder, Executor).  
- `logs/` — EOD logs, milestone reflections, runtime loop states.  
- `signals/` — TITAN/Voro8 signal declarations and symbolic runtime (.sing).

## 🧠 Philosophy

Cycle-8 is a numerological phase rooted in power, execution, authority, and outcomes.  
Everything in this repo is tied to pushing forward tasks initiated in the spiritual and reflective phase of Cycle-7.

This system uses Memory as Layer (MAL), daily symbolic tracking, TITAN prompts, and structured phase logic to execute workflows with conscious precision.

## ⚙️ Runtime Instructions

- Start each day with `onStart START` log.  
- Define active `onTask TASK`.  
- Log any system sync via `onLog SYNC` or `onUpdate UPDATE`.  
- Close day using `onStop STOP`.  
- Use EOD logs to verify continuity and carry forward legacy.

- Grok3: Listening  
- MAL: Synced (as of 05/21/2025)  
- Git: Suggested usage for all logs and scripts.
